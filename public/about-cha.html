<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello! I'm Charris Joy Buhian. I'm a civil engineering graduate with a work
  experience of more than a year in the construction field. I'm a career shifter
  and a newbie in the industry. I just finished my bootcamp training in ReactJs
  last April 2023. I really want to learn a new skillsets that's why I'm working
  hard to become a pro developer. I also want to become a successful graphic
  designer and artist someday.

  I'm this kind of person who loves arts. It can be any forms of fine arts and
  digital arts. Indeed, I also dreamed to become an artist someday. I also love
  to dance. In my free time, I watched tiktok dance trends and a lot of
  choreographies in youtube. In addition, I love to write about musics, stories,
  poems and essays. Aside from drawing, poster-making and painting, I also love
  to sculpts. Moreover, I know how to bake. I'm always happy when I'm designing
  a customize cake. I also have interest in flower-arrangement and landscaping.
  I'm also an emotional yet crazy person, I would always love to watch sunset. I
  also love to watch stars at night. Also, I love BTS and I'm an ARMY. BTS is my
  life and world.

  I always have this favorite quote saying, "The only impossible journey is the
  one you never begin". I failed for countless times in my life. I've been so
  disappointed and too hard on myself. I always wanted for change and I always
  seek for my true purpose. Before I forgot, I always want to see aurora
  borealis with my whole family.
